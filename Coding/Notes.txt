Make your own models in Blender.

Some Tips:
- Press “G” or Transform to move it anywhere if you need.
- Press “R” or Rotate to rotate it around.
- Press “S” or Scale to resize it.
- You can also use the Properties panel (press that plus sign on the top-right to turn on) to modify properties of the object.
- There are also some toggle-able buttons below with appropriate icons to transform, rotate, and scale.
- All the above can be done in Object mode.
- Press “Tab” to toggle between Object and Edit mode.
- There is a 3D cursor that you can move by left-clicking on some spot, which will be the place where new objects will appear if you decide to add some. This can be centered by clicking Object/Mesh (depending on if you’re on Object or Edit mode) > Snap > Cursor to Center.
